#INFO
My real name is Khaled Eid. 23 years old. I lived in Saudi Arabia before for 11 years. Now, I am living in Egypt.

#Overview
Cybersecurity was my major in college. After that, I got more knowledge from certificates and training at big institutions, from the National Telecommunication Institute of Egypt to VODAFONE. Interesting in Malware Analysis, seeking to be MALWARE RESEARCHER.
I went all in on writing for your technical blog.
