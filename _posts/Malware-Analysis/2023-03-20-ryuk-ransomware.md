# <u>Info</u>

My name is Khaled Eid.

Status: fresh graduate

Locations: I lived in Saudi Arabia for 11 years. Now, I am living in Egypt.

# <u>Overview</u>

Cybersecurity was my major in college. After that, I got more knowledge from certificates and training at big institutions, from the National Telecommunication Institute of Egypt to VODAFONE.

I'm interested in malware analysis and want to become a malware researcher expert.

# <u>What do you expect from me?</u>

The ability to write articles on cyber security for the general public and reports about real attacks and trending vulnerabilities for technical readers.

I went all in on writing for your technical blog.
